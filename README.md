## Docs

- It's way too simple for you to use this library into your code, all you have to do is call cuteAlert() and pass it's arguments in object notation.

```
buttonText is an optional parameter, by default it's set as "OK".
```

```
"type" will define what kind of alert box will be shown.
```

```
cuteAlert() returns a Promise, so you can use "then" to execute an action after the modal window is closed
```

```
As for the question alert box, you can choose what you want to do after any of the buttons is pressed with "then" aswell.
```

### Close button as a circle

- If you wish to have the close button styled as a circle, you need to pass ```closeStyle: "circle``` in your cuteAlert() arguments.
